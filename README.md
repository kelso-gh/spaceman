They start with 6 limbs/lives and 1 is deducted everytime the player guesses incorrectly. Once they've reached the alotted number of guesses, the astronaut disappears and the player loses ending the game.

If the player does not exceed the alotted number of limbs/lives and guesses the word, they win the game and it resets.
